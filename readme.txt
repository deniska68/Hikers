First of all hikers have only one torch. Thats why somebody must hold it, cross the bridge with someone else and go back to take 
the rest of hikers one by one. 

Obviosly the torch holds the fastest hiker. To get minimum whole time of going back to take the next hiker can only fastest hiker.
They are two of them for each crossing - fastest and somebody else.


Additional hikers need help. I supposed they can cross the bridge but they do not have their own torch. Thats why if somebody among them is faster than
every hiker from the main group than he holds the torch.

I prepared two methods to calculate the minimum time of crossing the bridges.

First one implements algorithm and uses two methods to calculate time of hikers and time of hikers with additional hikers.
Second one implements the same algoritnm but uses two clases with one virtual method.

Because I am very new in yaml files I did not do reading of the files of such type. I put all input data as the constants.

But actually both methods can be used for any number of hikers and bridges.
